# PalaceNFT Project Description
PalaceNFT is the first of its kind decentralized finance hub on Algorand blockchain to enable liquid lending markets for NFTs. PalaceNFT strives to become the financial marketplace where users can pledge their NFT assets to borrow or lend their tokens to earn interest with low transaction fees and fast transaction time.
Our team possesses extensive blockchain technology background and has identified an opportunity in a combined Defi and NFT use case by leveraging Algorand blockchain technology to develop a platform for providing liquidity through collaterised NFT loans.
Our platform will be available to people all over the world. The main issues PalaceNFT aims to solve are:
-	borrowing from the traditional financial industry is too difficult and too slow
-	low liquidity and pricing difficulties in today's hot NFT market


## Project Solution
The solutions from PalaceNFT are:
•	Provide a Defi and NFT platform leveraging Algorand’s smart contract and ASAs that assists users to pledge their NFT assets to borrow or lend their tokens to earn interest
•	Allowing businesses or users in need of capital to create NFTs representing their physical assets (such as patents) as collateral for lending that help them raise funds while maximizing the value of their intellectual properties
•	Help users who have a lot of high-value NFTs or have a lot of idle funds to use their assets more efficiently and keep their money flowing and avoid waste
